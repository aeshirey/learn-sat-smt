# Rectangle-Packing

The [Rectangle packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle_packing) is a problem where "the objective is to determine whether a given set of small rectangles can be placed inside a given large polygon, such that no two small rectangles overlap."

_Note: Due to the ever-increasing number of s-expressions required for problems such as this, the primary focus will be on the Z3 Python API. A few raw s-expressions will be shown for demonstration, but the implementation will be in Python._
